1. Create your own knowledge base about selected web services using OWL language. The outcome should be provided as a
 turtle file including triples: classes, properties and instances. Please remember - the ontology should allow to
 describe web services (no partucylar items nor particular goods).

2. Upload your ontology into RDF4J triple store.

3. Define meaningful, distinctrive queries (at least 5) and run them against your knowledge base. You will need a
SPARQL endpoint to do that. You can use a web service (for example RDF4J - server+workbanch) or editor (for example
Protege or Top Braid Composer) with SPARQL feature enable. The outcome should be provided as a text file with SPQRQL
queries.

4. Access your ontology programmatically (run defined queries using RDF4J library and display recived results).
